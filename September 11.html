				<h2>September 11th</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from last time?</h2></section>
				<section><h2>The Analects 論語</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Historical Background</h2><aside class='notes'><p>David Hinton elects to begin the tale of conficanism in the Shang Dynasty, which we've discussed at the begining of the course. Hinton argues that Confucianism emerged as a development across many years in reaction to varying ideas about governemnetal legitimacy</p>
				<p>In the Shang dynasty, rulers were conveyed legitimacy via their direct relationship with Shang di (this is who was translated as "God" in the Dao de Jing" but is more simply called Celestial Lord by Hinton (often left untranslated as SHang Di)</p>
				<p>According to Legend, The Shang kings were actually descended from the Shang Di, and they derived their authority to rule from his blessing. This means that in the earliest days (and throughout imperial history even) that emperorers were consider semi-dieties and were able to influence, if not necessarily control all aspects of the univers ("weather, harvest, politics economics, religion, etc."</p>
				<p>In echos that we will see throughout this course, by the late Shang dynasty things were not going nearly so well, but people harkened back to the good old days when the rulers benevolant.</p>
				<p>The shang evnetually collapsed as a result of poor treatement of the people, pressure from neighboring tribes (who would eventually found the Zhou) </p>
				<p>In a tale as old as time, the Zhou supposedly adopted much of the culture of the Shang dynasty (similear stories are told about the Yuan when they concored the Song and the Qing when the concoured the Ming, though there is significant evidence that the cultural infleunces went both ways and that the Qing emperors maintained throghouly Manchu identities (in addition to integrating with local culture).</p>
				<p>Yet the Zhou had a legitimacy issue on their hands. If the Shang rulers were able to govern via their lineal relationshipo with Shang Di, how could the Zhou claim legitimacy? The solution essentially came with the creation of the idea of the Mandate of Heaven. Rather than being naturally imbued by a diety with the right to rule, the mandate of heaven gave someone who was worthy authority to rule. Should one become unworthy, then the mandate of heaven could move</p>
				<p>Hinton poitns out this is an imrotnat inflection point where the ruler was suddenly obligated not just to rule, but to rule ethically.</p>
				<p>Eventually, like the Shang before it, the Zhou begins to hit rocky times and has to deal with the fact that now that the mandate of heaven can be transferred, they may well lose it. At the time local nobles were becoming increasingly powerful, and began to excersize as much, or more, influence than the emperor. These people began fighting among themselves, and eventually the Zhou began to all apart.</p>
				<p>This is where we find Confucius enter the picture. Social norms were breaking down and it was difficult to know who was properly governing and using authority.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Confucius 孔丘/孔夫子</h2><aside class='notes'><p>So Conficus lived in the late Spring and Autumn period from 551-479 BC</p>
				<p>Like Laozi, we don't know a whole lot about his actual life, but unlike Laozi, Confucius was unequivecolly a historical figure. He was born in the state of Lu, which is in modern day Shanghai, in a state that was still clinging to many of the traditions of the Zhou to a family that had roots in the Shang nobility</p>
				<p>By the time he came around, however, his family was extremely poor. He was a very studious young person, and tradition has it that he worked in lower positions in the government, but little is known of this</p>
				<p>We do know that Confucius was extremly outspoken and strong ideas about how the government should be run, which lead to some conflict throughout his life. In the end he devoted his life to teaching men who would become ministers in various places throughout the empire. Hinton points out there is a bit of cruel irony here, because confucius's students would work for people who Confucius himself hated and who did not listen to him.</p>
				<p>Later in life, when he was nearly 50, he did occupy the role of Minister of Justice in Lu, but he left angry that they were ignoring his ideas about government, and he traveled for the next thirteen years of his life teaching people who would listen to him. In his sixties he returned to Lu and finished his days as a teacher.</p>
				<p>He is credited with creating the Five classics (the book of poetry, book of documents, obok of rites, the yi jing, and the spring and autumn annals), which are a  collection of imoprtant eralier texts. Other important texts in the confian tradition include the great learning, the doctrine of the mean, the analects of course, and the mengzi or mencius</p></aside></section>
				
				<section><h2>The Analects</h2><aside class='notes'><p>There are interesting parellels between the analects and the dao de jing. The first is that Confucius did not write the Analects. Rather, his students gathered together many of his sayings and compiled them into a book. It also takes many older ideas and reshaps them. It is told via aphorism (this is sort of like Socrates, whose teaching survive from his students)</p>
				<p>there are a lot of textual traditions related to the analects, and it is not clear what constitutes an "authentic" version of them. There is a lot of research focused on exactly this, many works were rewritten from memory after the Qin emperor tried to ahve all philosophical books burned.</p>
				<p>Hinton is right to point out that some of these condtradict others, suggesting that they were never really said by Confucius, and other things that he certainly said were recorded in other sources but didn't make it into the Analects.</p>
				<p>As you most likely know, among all of the ideas that flourished in the late Spring and Autumn period and early warring states period, Confucianism was the one that had the most success, with later Chinese governments claiming to be acting under one or another interetations of its ideals.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Model of Governance</h2><aside class='notes'>Confucius argues that the state should mimic the family</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Relation with Deities</h2><aside class='notes'><p>You may have gotten the sense fromt he Dao de jing and the book of poetry that dieties, or at least the supernatural played some role in how poeple understood the unverise, and you be right</p>
				<p>Remember that the Shang argued that authority was derived from a diety, and the Zhou was focused on the madnate of heaven.</p>
				<p>Conficus himself largely avoided any mention or involvement with the supernatural, except to the extent that he argued people should follow the old rituals. Hinto describes Confucius as having a "rational empiricism."</p>
				<p>Confucius's philosophy evolved out of the idea that here is an inherent structure to society that is based on the relationships between people. How you should act should be in accordance with your place in this structure. Children obey parents, subjects obey rulers, and so on.</p>
				<p>Hinton says that Confucus primarily argues that community depends on people caring for each other (but the nature of this obligation to others depends on the distance of the relationship). Nurture first, teach second, govern last. After all, hadn't the Shang dynasty failed when they stopped taking care of the people?</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Ritual 禮</h2><aside class='notes'><p>The extent of confucius' engagment with the supernatural has to do with ritual actions. Unlike the ritual of the sShang, focused on worshiping supernatural, ritual becomes part of the way rulers fullfil responsibiliuy to the community.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Power Dynamics</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Some of argued that the focus on peoples obligations ritually and to their superiors creates an authoritarian ideology, but this is somethign that confucian philosophers immediately sought to fight against, by focusing very hard not on peoples responsibilities, but the governemnts resonsibility to the people</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Gentleman 君子</h2><aside class='notes'><p>The primary goal of a person is to become a junzi, or gentleman, and many of the instructinos within the analects are focused on this. Confucius essentially redefines this to mean a person of talent and learning (rather than someone of nobel birth)</p><p>One can attain this status through extensive stdy. These people should follow the Dao (but this is markedly NOT the dao of daoism), instead it is comporting with the ritual structure of society. The best practictioners of the Dao were the old sage rulers. He ruled by doing nothing becuase he was so good at the rituals! Page 13 top quote read</p>
				<p>There are a lot of philosophical overlaps between daoism and confucianism, but the perscritpions for action are very different. The dao takes care of it self for Confucius, so we should be concerned with human action</p></aside></section>
