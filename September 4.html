				<section><h1>Chinese Literature in English</h1>
				<h2>September 4</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from last time?</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Women Shamans in Ancient China</h2><aside class='notes'>Yes, I looked into it, and women were prominently involved in divination and general shamanistic practice. It seems that there particularly involved in the process of rain making in the very early days.</aside></section>
				
				<section><h2>The Book/Classic of Odes/Songs 詩經</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>This is the oldest collection of poetry extant from China, and really the oldest thing that most would consider truely literature that we talk about in this class. It contains 305 poems which were originally accompanied with music, although this has long been lost. These poems come from a long time frame (9th century to 7th century BC) As it stands, for many years people believed that Confucius had an important hand in editing this collection and by all indications he believed that they contained important guidance for how to act.</p><p>It is also useful to consider how works get reinterpreted over the years: in early days, people read these poems politically and historically: we should act like the heros in these and not like the vilians. As you will probably have noted in reading the footnote, later scholars prefered to view these as literary and not really political (though there is a close connection between the literary and political throughout Chinese Literature.</p></aside></section>
				<section><p>Airs of the States 國風</p><p>Lesser Ya 小雅</p><p>Greater Ya 大雅</p><p>Temple Hymns (Eulogies) 頌</p>
				<aside class='notes'><p>Structurally the classic is divided into two (or four) sections depending on how you divide it.</p><p>The largest portion of the text (160 poems, though they are shorter than the other sections) are the Airs of the States, the guo feng. These are mostly folk songs and scholars see them as reflective on common culture.</p> <p>The Lesser and Greater Ya are sometimes called court hymns and may have been ritual songs.</p><p>The Eugologies are unsprisingly eulogies and were often perfomred at court as part of sacraficial rites. </p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>4 syllable rhyming lines</h2></section>
				<section><h2><a href="https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%A9%A9%E7%B6%93/%E9%97%9C%E9%9B%8E">The Ospreys</a></h2><aside class='notes'><p>Let's take a close look at the very first poem in the collection, generally calle dthe ospry. Here I am showing you the Wiki Source version of teh text, and I know many of you don't ready Chinese, so don't worry. But this is an openly accessible collection of Chinese texts (and if you are curious, we can actually do a lot of text mining with tis. But note, here is the poem. All this extra stuff is commentary.</p><p>Can somebody read the version in the Shorter Columbia reader? page 61. What are your thoughts on this?</p></aside></section>
				<section><p>Another translation</p><aside class='notes'>Let's take a look at Arthur Whaley's translation (14/15 in pdf pgs 81 and 82). Can someone read this? What are your thoughts? Which one do you prefer?</aside></section>
				<section><p>Ezra Pound's "translation"</p><aside class='notes'>Does anyone know who Ezra Pound was? He was a very important modernist poet, and like many modernist poets wound up in europe and turned out to be a bit of a facist, supporting Musilleni in Italy and Hitler in Germany. Some critics view his translations, which were often done collaboratively with others as very poetically astute, even though he was unable to read Chinese. Can someone read this? Thoughts?</aside></section>

				<section><h2>64</h2></section>
				<section><h2>113</h2></section>
				<section><h2>245</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Arthur Waley's Translation</h2><aside class='notes'>Sadly he set up his own ordering, though his translations were quite good in general. He is one of the most famous translaters of Chinese poetry, and lived from 1889 until 1966. He toook a job at the British Musuem taking care of print materials from asia</aside></section>
