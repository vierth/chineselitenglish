				<section><h2>Questions from last time?</h2></section>
				<section><h2>A brief timeline of Early Chinese History</h2></section>
				<section data-background-iframe="http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/timelines/china_timeline.htm">
				<aside class="notes">Today we are going to be talking about writings that are extremely old and date from the 13th centurty BC, during the Shang Dynasty. You'll note on this timeline the oldest dynasty is the Xia. As it is prehistoric, most of what we know about the Xia is largely legendary. No writing dates from this period and earliest mentions date from the Western Zhou, nearly 800 years after it supposedly occured. Later we will touch on some of these legends. Our focus today is the Shang Dynasty, the period from which the oldest Chinese writing dates.</aside></section>

					<aside class="notes">Here we have an example of an oracle bone. The way this works is that when someone needed some diviation to be done to predict things related to births, harvests, whatever, they would take a cow bone or a turtle shell and then take a hot poker and stab the item. The extreme heat forms cracks, and the divination expert would interpret these. After the interpretation, the event and results of the prediction would often be written on the bone. Only relatively recently have archaeologists successfully begun to decipher these (in the last hundred or so years)</aside></div>

				</section>
				<section><h2>A Late Shang Divination Record</h2>
				<aside class="notes">Take a look at the record. Note the tripartite composition recording when the divination took place, the prediction (done by the king) and then the actual result.</aside></section>
				<section><h2><a href="http://www.hko.gov.hk/gts/time/stemsandbranches.htm">The Sexagenary Cycle</a></h2>
				<aside class='notes'>You'll notice that this is closely related with astrology, chinese medicine, and all sorts of similar things</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Bronze Inscriptions</h2></section>
				<section data-background-iframe="https://www.christies.com/features/Collecting-guide-Ancient-Chinese-bronzes-8638-1.aspx"></section>
				
				<section><h2>Bronze Inscription</h2><aside class="notes">Bronzes were usually produced to commemorate important occasions, and had inscriptions on the inside and on the upper lip, and sometimes on the outside surface. The inscription that we read today was commemorates a battle between the Zhou king Xuan against the Xianyun. The reading is actually extremely long and not really representative of many of the bronzes from the period, which tended to have very short inscriptions. Some of these were also used as items in burials.</aside></section>

				<section><h2>The Yijing</h2><h2>易經</h2><h2>The Book of Changes</h2>
				<aside class="notes">IN the earliest days this was used as a divination manual, but later it was considered to be a philosophical text. </aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Eight Trigrams</h2><h2>☰ ☱ ☲ ☳ ☴ ☵ ☶ ☷</h2>
				<aside class="notes">You will note that each of these trigrams is made up of three lines, which can be either broken or unbroken. In the oldest days these were meant to be "yes" and "no." Eventually a second line was added to them, and then eventually a third line to form the eight trigrams. These each had their own meaning: pg l (preface)</aside></section>
