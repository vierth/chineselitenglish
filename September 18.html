				<h2>September 18th</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from last time?</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Li Sao 離騷</h2>
				<p>On Encountering Sorrow</p></section>
				<section><h2>Chu ci 楚辭</h2><p>Songs of the South</p><aside class='notes'><p>This is perhaps the most famous collection of early poetic works outside of the Classic of Poetry, which we discussed a few weeks ago.</p>
				<p>Unlike the Classic of Poetry, the Songs of the South is a little more coherent, and reflects the local style and culture of the time (which we will get into shortly.) </p>
				<p>While the Classic of Poetry was a reflection of courtly style and interests in the spring and autumn period (and highly respected by Confucius), the Songs of the south were a different beast altogether. It was written much later, largely during the Fourth century BC and contains a very different style of work</p>
				<p>A man named Wang Yi put together the Chu Ci as a collection of texts during the 2nd century AD, though he claims that he was just pushing forward a book put together by Liu Xiang who worked during the first century BC. We only really have confirmation that Wang Yi was involved.</p>
				<p>Most people think that around half of the poems were by a man named Qu Yuan, and the other half were written in similar styles across the following few hundred years</p>
				<p>there is some debate on the exact authorship of some of the poems, but the general shape of the anthology is fairly well understood.</p>
				</aside></section>
				<section><img src='resources/chu.jpg' style='max-width:40%'><p style='font-size: .2em'>From Hawkes, "Songs of the South" p. 1</p><aside class='notes'><p>The songs themself come from Chu, one of the kingdoms active during the warring states period. </p>
				<p>This was the largest of the countries that wer eventually unified under the Qin.</p>
				<p>This was an area that was considered unciviliazed in the days of the Zhou and formed mostly of "barbarians" as they were usually called.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Qu Yuan 屈原</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Like the other people we have discussed in this class, much of what we know about Qu Yuan comes from Sima Qian's biogrpahy of him in the Records of the grand historian.</p>
				<p>Some people in the early 20th century actually claim he was legendary, though that seems to be pretty unlikely.</p>
				<p>Anyway, according to Sima Qian, Qu Yuan was an official in Chu and worked for King Huai (who reigned 328-288 B.C></p>
				<p>He was highly respected by the king, but had a rival who would always slander him. His rival even stole some of Qu's draft laws and presented them as his own. Qu stopped this, and the rival slandered him.</p>
				<p>The king fell fr this, and Qu was very sad about it. Sima Qian saw the Lisao as a complaint about the ignorance of the king.</p>
				<p>Qu Yuan was dismissed from court and in the meantie things didn't go so well for Chu, but Qu was persona non grata there when King Huai was replaced with Qingxiang who disliked Qu (as did his younger brother Zilan the prime minister. After more military failures, Qu was continuously slandered, and eventually this happened</p>
				<p>From Hawkes "Qu Yuan came to the banks of the River. With his hair hanging down in disarray he wandered to the water's edge, singing as he went. His expression was dejected and his features emaciated... clasping a stone to his bosom, he threw himself into the river Miluo and perished...After Qu Yuan's death, Chu produced other poets... all of whom were skilled in composition and became famous for writing fu. All based themselves on Qu Yuan's free style but none dared imiate his outspoken satire. From this time onwards Chu declined with ever increasing rapidity and within half a century was compltely overwhelemed by Qin."</p>
				<p>Qu was revered in the Han because of his literary skill and the illfated life he lived in which he remained continually loyal to his king. Poets would in fact write poems in his honor and drop them into the river to comfort Qu Yuan's ghost. Now people throw zongzi into the river in a simlar fashion.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Style</h2><aside class='notes'><p>You may have noticed that the style of this poem is significantly different that what we've seen in class to this point. There are some interesting features that aren't as evident in translation</p>
				<p>Remember that the Classic of Poetry was constructed mainly of four syllable lines. There are two major styles of poetry in the Chu Ci, the "Sao" style, which is similar to the what we read today, and the "song" style, which many of the other poems are examples of.</p>
				<p>The Song style poems tend to have six characters per line, with "xi" as the fourth character, where as the Sao style poems are usually longer with seven and six syllabus with the first line always ending in "xi"</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>xi 兮</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>This character is one of the strangest things abou the poems in the Chu Ci, because it doesn't really mean anything but it instead stands in a rhytmic marker, and some people speculate it was where music would have been allowed to go wild during the performing of a poem (because remember that these poems would often be performed).</p>
				<p>Eventually this xi was dropped, and much later poetry was pentasyllabic, so critics argue this was an important locus of the stylistic development of Chinese poetry. The songs turned into the pentasyllabic poems and the sao style turned into the fu or the rhapsody, which tended towards prose.</p></aside></section>
				<section><a href='https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E9%9B%A2%E9%A8%B7'>Text of the Lisao</a></section>
				<section><h2>Point of View</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>Interestingly, the Lisao is all told from the first person perspective, and the in the voice of a woman. The use of the first person becomes a trope of the genrea nd early all Sao style poems are as such. They also discuss purity against corruption.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Interpretation</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Many confucian scholars of the time insited that EVERYTHING in this poem is alegorical and represents the realtionship between a minister and his king, though most modern commentors really doubt this</p>
				<p> Sima Qian compares it with the Classic of Poetry: "The Songs of the States are sensual without being Licentious; the Lesser Ya poems are plantive without being seditious. Li Sao may be said to combine these to virtues."</p>
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Reflection of Chu Culture</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Among the many interesting things about the Chuci is that the poem reflects the culture of the state of Chu, which is actually qutie different than the Zhou culture espoused by Confucius (and that Zhuangzi existed in)</p>
				<p>this is a cultural that fundamentally believes in the power of magic, and religion is a combination of "ancestor worship and animism" and shamans are a fundamental part of the culture (men and women), these are people who are able to call upon nature for help.</p>
				<p>The supernatural is a very real thing to the author of the Lisao, says Hawkes, though he doubts the thoughts of those influenced by the pom</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Poem</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>Read Page 21 "Unlike the other Chu Ci poets..."</p><p>Let's go through line by line, as this isn't too long, but it is really facinating. Let's take turns reading</p></aside></section>
