				<h2>September 16th</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from last time?</h2></section>
				<section><h2>The Zhuangzi 莊子</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Today we are going to be looking at the second major work in teh Daoist tradition. we will talk a lot about the stylistic differences between this and the laozi, note that htis is told mostly in fables.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Zhuangzi the person</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>This is the follow up to the Lao Zi. He was a contemporary of Mengzi, so the two of them represent the second generation of philosophers in those two tradtions, living about 100 years after confucius.</p>
				<p>His given name was Zhou, and he was from "meng", though it is not exactly clear where that was (some think it was in modern day Henan, possibly in the state of Song). He lived during the 4th century BC, and what little we know about his life comes from the Records of the Grand Historian (recall that Laozi's informaitno was recorded in the same way). There is some biographical information in the book itself, but Burton Watson doubts its historical veracity. Watson speculates that if Zhuangzi were from the state of Song, he would have grown up in an environment which was commited to the rites from the Shang dynasty (as we can recall confucius was).</p>
				<p>We also don't really know what connection the historical Zhuangzi has with the book istelf. Unlike the Laozi, it is assumed that the person who wrotes this was genearlly speaking the thinker behind the ideas as well (though its complicated textual history may obscrue this significantly).</p>
			<p></p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Structure</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Inner chapters, outer chapters, miscellaneous Chapters</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Changes to the Text</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Guo Xiang edited the text about 600 hundred years after it was first written. He was firmly of the opinion that many of the items in the book at his time had been added and were not authentic. He rearranged the chapters into the three sections I mentioned, and reduced the total number of chapters from 52 to 33.</p>
				<p>Guo thought that only the first seciton, the inner chapters, were actualy by Zhuangzi. He thoguht the outer chapters were likely by like minded htinkers (modern scholars think the latter part of the book were indeed by other folks).</p>
				<p>Daoists have conventionally treated the whole book as canon.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Themes</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Watson says the central conciet of the Zhuangzi is "freedom". Recall the main focus of these early philsoophers was to bring order tothe insanity taht was happening around them.</p>
				<p>Like laozi, the goal was to become free of the world.</p>
				<p>One must discard conventional ideas.</p>
				<p>Focused on spiritual side of things and a bit less on the political and intellectual elite.</p>
				<p>5: Middle of first full graph. "One device he uses to great effect is the non-sequitur."</p>
				<p>paradoxes and humor</p>
				<p>Wu wei for Zhuangzi is focused on "action  that is not founded upon any purposeful motives of gain or striving." The focus is spontenaity.</p>
				<p>He compares this with artisans: woodcarvers, butchers, etc</p>
				<p>Zhuangzi holds that the way can't be truely described, like laozi, but he does again use a whole lot of words to provide a rough outline</p>
				<p>7 top read </p>
				<p>Unclear relationship with the Daodejing, no direct mentinos but there is soemtimes similarilty in wording, even though the Daodejing is considered a foundational text in daoism, much like the zhuangzi is</p>
				<p>Daoism was a popular philosophy though eventually Confucianism won the day (no supression, just less popular). It is perhaps critical to recognize that Daoism is fairly apolitcal, so many Confucianists also considered themselves daoists (though it was releid upon as a mode of protest)</p>
				<p>There are an extraordinary number of commentaries that have been written, but some secitons are still unclear to people (so don't worry if you struggled to understand them)</p>
