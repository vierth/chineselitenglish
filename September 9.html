				<section><h2>Lao Tzu 老子</h2><h2>Dao De Jing 道德經</h2><aside class='notes'><p>The book we are reading today is known variously as the Laozi, or as the Dao de Jing (sometimes translated as the Way and the Virtue). The second name comes from the structure of the work, the first part begins with the Word "Dao" and the second begins with "de" (ignoring some characters with relatively little meaning). It is called the Lao Tzu by convention, while it seems to be a collection of wise saying, there is never a name mentioned in the book.</p><p>It is also a book that rhymes throughout much of its content. This seems to suggest that the stories were originally passed around orally, as the rhyming would have helpd audiences remember it.</p></aside></section>
				<section><img src='resources/laozi.jpg' style="max-width:30%;"><p style="font-size:.2em;">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi#/media/File:Zhang_Lu-Laozi_Riding_an_Ox.jpg</p><p style="font-size:.2em;">http://painting.npm.gov.tw/Painting_Page.aspx?dep=P&PaintingId=3236</p><aside class='notes'><p>The Laozi is named for the sage who supposedly uttered many of the things contained within this text. I say supposedly, because there is significant confusion related to who Laozi was and if he was truely a historical person. He was a contemporary with Confucius, who lived from 551 to 479 BC (though Laozi was a number of years older than him), but there is relatively little know about Laozi himself.</p>
				<p>The first biography of Laozi dates from the Sima Qian's Shiji, which was the 1st century BC history that I've mentioned a couple times in class (known as the Records of the Grand Historian). According to this biography, He was from the state of Chu from Li village in Hu county and his name was Li'er, style named Tan. The story goes here that Confucius sought Laozi's advice when it came to the proper coducting of rites.</p><p>Supposedly he told confucious READ intro page viii halfway down page.</p><p>Confucious allegedly said READ viii toward bottom.</p><p>At a certain point, Laozi elects to leave civilization because it was declining around him. On leaving through the pass, the keeper of the pass asked him to write a book about his ideas, in whcih he ostencibly set down the Dao De jing (also known as the five thousand character classic, given its length.) He then left civilization. The story goes that he was riding on an ox, hence this Ming Dynasty painting.</p>
				<p>Sima Qian argues that there was another person who contributed to the Daoist cannon who wrote a book in 15 sections that expounded Daoist philosophy. His name was Lao Lai Zi (and if this WAS laozi is not entirely apparent from the modern viewpoint)</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the claim is that Laozi lived to extreme old age, 160 to 200 years. I recently saw a study that links peolple with extreme old age to lack of birth certificates.</p><p>The Shiji makes reference to the fact that hte daoists and the confuciansts did not get along well, which is definitely the case.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h3>Confucius meets Lao Tzu</h3><img src='resources/kong-lao-m.jpg'><p  style="font-size:.2em;">https://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln471/Images471/kong-lao-m.jpg</p><aside class='notes'><p>This Yuan dynasty painting depicts this meeting.</p> <p>Interestingly, confucius's biography gives a different account of this meeting READ page x 2nd graph</p><p>It is important to point out that so little was known about who Laozi was that Sima Qian is recording what amount to folk tales. D.C. Lau, the translator of the version we are reading actually argues that Laozi probably was not a real hsitorical figure, but was instead an amalgamation of hermit like figures who tended towards some hostility to Confucianism and was ascribed authorship of this book. Lau argues that these ideas didn't really emerge until the 3rd century BC, a few hundred years after Laozi supposedly lived. It's also useful to note that Laozi simply means "old man" or 'old master" and the work is simly associated with a wise person of old age. It may be that the Laozi of Confucian fame just coincidentally had the same name as this collection of wise sayings.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Philosophical Flourishing</h2><aside class='notes'>It is worth noting that the period we are discussing here when the Laozi was supposedly written was one of the richest in terms of the developmetn of Chinese philosophy. Next time we will be discussing Confucius, who also came from this period. Many of the philosophical texts that emerged in this period were focused on how governance should propelry be conducted. The Dao de jing advocates a signficantly different political and personal philosophy than Confucius did.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Inconsistant philosophy</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>Lao argues that it is difficult to draw a cohesive philosophy out of the Dao De Jing, because it a fragmentary text that likely drew together disparate thoughts from various daoist traditions. We'll look at the Zhuangzi later, which is a much more cohesive vision of Daoism than we see here. Still, this is fundamentally the foundational text of daoism</p><p>Remember that earlier I said that these likely circulated orally. Many imperial and modern scholars have argued at the best arrangment of sections to build a cohesive narrative.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Central Ideas</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>There are a number of central ideas found within the Laozi that are useful to understand before we dive in, because it is a bit obtuse in sections. Hopefully these will be clearer as we actually look at the content of the work.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Dao 道</h2><aside class='notes'>This is the central precept of daoism, and it is what the philosohpy is named after. One of the most important ideas in daoism is that the dao is not something that can be described, because language is inadequate. Once we get to the point that we can describe it, we are no longer talking about the dao. The dao creates and sustains the universe. The dao is also inherintly cyclical, which we will see in a moment. Critically, it is the job of many to act in accordance with the Dao. Note that dao replaces the concept of "heaven or tian" in daoism as the progenitor of the universe</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Virtue 德</h2><aside class='notes'>This is, interestingly enough, not really a super critical part of the philosophy espoused in the Laozi, in spite of its prominent place in the name. It tends to take on a ratehr conventional sense, but can be understoood as "what an object gets from the dao"</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Inaction 無為</h2><aside class='notes'>For people, the Laozi advocates inaction. This isn't truely don't do anything, but simply do not act against the Dao. Government is a natural part of the universe, but it should not actively pursue more territory, extraneous comfort and the like. The ruler should not interfere with natures balance and push things beyond the basic needs of the people to pursue desire. Avoid knowledge and desire, as building up these are destined to fall apart because it requires acting against the dao, which will always "turn back". Keep people in a childlike state</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Submissiveness 柔</h2>"The submissive and the weak overcome the hard and the strong." We'll see some explicity ways this shows up in the Zhuangzi later, but there are various ways to interpret this. Does this mean when tehe submissive overcomes it becomes Strong? We are supposed to hold fast to the submissive.</section>
				<section><h2>"Turning Back"</h2><aside class='notes'>The more desires one pursues the further one moves away from the way, which requires signficant energy and will end in a snap back to the mean with often disasterous concequences. Some ahve argued that the Dao De Jing presents a philosophy in which the weak become strong and the strong then become weak in a cyclical fashion. If you are in the other class, you can see this in the idea that once a state has existed for a long time it will fall apart, and when things have been broken apart for a while they will come back together. Lau argues that this process is not inevitable. Instead, one should try really hard to remain always weak even though humans try hard to become strong; this will always end in disaster. I think of this a bit like Cysaphus. Pushing a boulder up a hill is hard and the higher it gets, the further it will eventually fall. The Dao de jing advocates simply not pushing the boulder up the hill.</aside></section>
